# Active Directory Powershell
Just a repository of my powershell scripts I've made and use as an IT engineer. I've worked on them and they have been tested and work perfectly. You would just need to have the Active Directory Module for Powershell installed on your AD server to do it.

Some of the scripts include:
- Setting Expiry Dates on Accounts
- Removing and Adding to Groups

I hope you enjoy using these scripts and let me know what you think of them.
